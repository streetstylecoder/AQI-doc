Otrivin Plus Nasal Spray
Snuffles or nasal congestion is a problem commonly experienced in infants and children.1 However trivial it might sound, it becomes a point of concern if not treated well on time, because children are obligate nasal breathers. They breathe from their noses only. A blocked nose can make it difficult for them to breathe, sleep, and even feed.2

Worry not! Otrivin Baby Saline can help them get relief from their blocked nose. Otrivin Baby Saline with benefits of aloe vera helps to loosen the viscous nasal discharge produced in the nose. It also enhances the working of tiny hair-like structures lining the nasal cavity called the cilia. Thus, it gently cleanses and moisturises the nasal cavities, helping improve sleep in babies.3 
How it works
Otrivin Baby Saline is an isotonic solution that washes away the excess mucus present in the nasal passage. It also cleans nasal cavities to help eliminate pathogens (bacteria / viruses), allergens, pollutants and fine particles that might have entered your child’s nose from the air. Otrivin Baby Saline has the goodness of aloe vera that provides further moisturisation to the baby’s nasal passage.

Lean your head forward slightly and insert the nozzle into a nostril.
Spray and breathe in gently through the nose at the same time.

Be careful not to spray in the eyes.

If the full spray is not administered, the dose should not be repeated.
